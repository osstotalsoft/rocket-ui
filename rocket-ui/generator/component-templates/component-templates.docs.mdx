### Using your Generator

For creating a new component you should use our own component generator, `rocket-generator` ðŸš€, that provides a template which is helpful in implementing new components.

```bash
bit create rocket-generator components/buttons/my-component
```

The above command will create a new folder inside `buttons`, named `my-component`, with the following structure:

* `index.js`                           Entry file.
* `MyComponent.js`                     Main file.
* `MyComponent.test.js`                Test file.
* `MyComponent.docs.mdx`               Docs file for the component.
* `compositions`                       Compositions folder.
    * `MyComponent.composition.js`     Compositions for simulating the component in different states and contexts.

Each file will have a minimum implementation to get you started!

Run `bit templates` to see your generator and then use it to generate you components.
